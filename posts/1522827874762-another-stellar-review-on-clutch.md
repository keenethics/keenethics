<span id="_gjdgxs" class="anchor"></span>Recently, one of our clients
took the time to review us on [*Clutch*](https://clutch.co/developers),
the leading B2B ratings and reviews platform. We are so happy with the
feedback that was received and would like to share more insight about
our most recent five-star review.

One of clients came to us with requirements to design and develop a
finance ratings platform for both
[*web*](https://keenethics.com/services-web-development) and
[*mobile*](https://keenethics.com/services-mobile-development) devices.
Using technologies like React.js for frontend development and
[*Node.js*](https://clutch.co/developers/nodejs) for the backend,
Keenethics was able to successfully deliver the first phase of the
project incorporating multi-varied search capabilities.

Our client commended Keenethics for our *“sophistication on technology
and keen business judgment”* and highlighted that our code quality was
*“very reliable, tight, and reflective.”* We are so happy with the
feedback that was received, especially because we are in the process of
narrowing our specializations. This particular project used new
technologies that we plan on using in future projects and involved user
interface design work, a service that we now offer.

Keenethics joined Clutch in June and since then we’ve had 5 five-star
reviews. Our clients’ feedback has been amazing. Below are some excerpts
of our other reviews on our
[*profile*](https://clutch.co/profile/keenethics):

<div>
  <p style="font-style: oblique; padding-left: 30px;">“They did a nice job of taking interest and ownership of the work
  that they did…Overall, Keenethics’ personal touch was a highlight for
  me.” – CTO, Tech Strategy Consultancy</p>

  <p style="font-style: oblique; padding-left: 30px;">“They feel like a business partner, not like an agency that just
  wants to sell more hours.” – Founder, E-Commerce Marketing Platform*</p>

  <p style="font-style: oblique; padding-left: 30px;">“From a technological standpoint, they did great work in terms of the
  results, consulting, and providing options.” - Manager, Strategic
  Management Consultancy*</p>

We would like to thank our clients for taking the time to review us on
Clutch. Thanks to their feedback and support.

As we grow as a company, our expertise has narrowed. Keenethics provides
UX/UI, front and backend development, and devops expertise in developing
custom mobile first web-applications for fintech companies. Our most
recent review is just an example of our new specialization. Be on the
lookout for our inclusion in Clutch’s upcoming fintech research and more
Clutch reviews.
