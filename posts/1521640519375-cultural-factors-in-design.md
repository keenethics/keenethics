Can you imagine that you have finally received a product which is
suitable, accessible, convenient and created in a way that all the
features have been taken into account?

If you have decided to create such kind of service and want it to be
used by clients from different countries and cultures, then you need to
transform and adapt. To put it in another words, you need to localize
it.

It is known that interface localization increases the popularity of
mobile app among similar products. Even such a simple thing as the
translation of product description and keywords on the page in an online
store has a positive effect on the number of downloads and sales figures
of this product.

For instance, the residents of some countries prefer to purchase
products using their native language even if they know English quite
well. The majority also prefers to use customer service in their native
language. If we take Europe which includes around 50 countries, almost
every has its regional peculiarity to display data, number or currency.
If we extend our audience around the world, then we need to think about
such countries as China, Iran, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, where the
text is written from right to left or from the top to the bottom and the
numbers are written with the use of Hindu-Arabic or Persian numbers.

Therefore, we recommend to make yourself aware of features which should
be taken into account in the first place.

# Language features

### Date and time format

The way you present time and date depends on the country. For instance,
the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand use 12-hour clock (English
system), while another part of the world uses 24-hour clock (French
system).

### Format of numbers, currency and units of measurement

Decimal and thousands separator may look like a comma, period or a
space. Also the position of currency may distinguish not only in
different languages but also in different countries. For instance, such
countries as Germany and Austria use the same language however they have
different currency format. You can find more detailed information on
[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\_and\_the\_euro*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_and_the_euro)

It is sometimes necessary to adapt to the national standards and by that
I mean the units of measurement. If they are used in your project, you
should always find out which system is accepted in one or another
country so that to inform the user about the speed, length, weight,
temperature etc.

### Font

Make sure that the fonts you use have characters for language
localization (mainly Asian languages, as well as Hebrew, Arabic and
special characters (diacritics) of European languages).

### Input forms

The text translated into foreign languages will be either shorter or
longer than the original text. In some cases the difference might be
dramatic. Do not limit the number of symbols in the fields for entering
a name and a surname since some nationalities might have several names
which can include four words.

### Content features

The user immediately perceives visual information so the main task of
localization is to avoid ambiguity.

Since the colour is an important source of information you need to learn
to apply it and make it beneficial for your content. Explore and align
with your target audience.

Let us take a stock market as an example. In the USA, UK and Japan the
positive indicator of a profitable offgoing middle diagram is green or
blue whereas the negative is red. However, in Taiwan and Korea, the use
of colours is opposite. In these two countries red symbolizes prosperity
and success. But the red checkmark in Japanese interface means you did
something wrong.

### Methods of localization

There are two possible directions if you find it important and ready to
improve. You can create your own approach or use ready made standards
and libraries like ECMAScript Internationalization API, i18next etc.

In fact, even if you are limited with one culture the situation might
turn out to be even more complex. The process of localization is not
restricted in choosing any system or focusing on various features of
languages ​​and cultures. Initially, the process of product development
should be focused on the users, their needs, desires and expectations.

Unfortunately, one universal solution does not exist, but if all the
features are taken into account your product will get on a new level of
user experience.

If your audience is quite large, you can involve users for translations.
Facebook and WhatsApp are translated in such way and Google translate
uses the same approach.

It is essential to develop the sense of empathy for the user since even
the smallest mistake may disrupt the interaction of native speakers with
your product.
