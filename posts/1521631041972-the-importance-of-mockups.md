Up to 50% of your budget will be spent on application design. The most
basic app that takes 160 hours to code can easily take as much time to
prepare a custom design. Please be aware that we are talking about
custom design, not just 3 USD theme bought on market-place. That’s the
case for another article.

## Why do I need to know that?

Many potential clients I talk to assume or hope that a frontend
developer is a person who will take care of the “feel” and “look” of the
app. Which is true, but he will take care of the engineering part not
actual choice of colours, shapes, fonts and other humanitarian stuff.
Most developers frown upon such requests. So when you write “Frontend
developer with good UI/UX skills” in your job post you are missing the
point, out of 20 frontend developers I can think of from the top of my
head - only one can create a great custom design.

## What it is.

It’s a static picture created in some Graphic Design Software such as
Sketch or Photoshop.

## How long?

Wowowow, hold your horses. Before we answer that question I’m going to
ask you once again WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT? Of course you want it to
“look nice”. Well I’ve got bad news for you it doesn't work like that.

1\) Can you tell how many pages or screens will the UI designer need to
draw?

2\) Is there a style guide the designer should follow or should he/she
come up with one?

3\) What functionality needs to be decorated?

4\) Is it a responsive design?

The answer to each of these questions will define how long it will take.

Here are some estimates from our in-house designer:

You should talk to the UX designer first, he/she’s the one who will
prepare the wire-frames of the application/website/landing page and only
then these wire-frames can be turned into a nice looking mockups.

## What it can be confused with.

<ol>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600">Design.</span> An abstract notion “design”. When I hear “design” first
    of all I think of the process where a designer sits down with a
    concept from the client and tries to present client’s vision
    through the right choice of colours, shapes and all that, so the
    Mockup is the end product of the design.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600">Prototype.</span> A Prototype and a Mockup are different because Mockup
    is static, and prototype means clickable image or even a rough
    production version of an app.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600">Wireframe.</span> A wireframe does not look good because it is not a
    design. It’s purpose is to plan the structure and the user flow
    scenarios.</li>
</ol>

## Why mockup is important.

> HTML (the visual part) CODING!

> 3) Your app needs to be appealing to the eye of a user. Examples: a

> to look good. NO MOCKUP - NO CLIENTS.

## How to save on this/When can I avoid this step?

Yes, I did say earlier that no mockup - no coding. There is an exception
if you have approved wire-frames then developers can implement them
without making your app beautiful.

Example 1: you can buy a theme and front-end developer can customize it.
But unfortunately it customization can take more time than designer
creates a mockup from scratch.

Example 2: Let’s say your app’s purpose is to locate a Bluetooth device,
it’s not the kind of app a user will be staring at for long, it can be
as simple as possible.

Example 3: if you are building a prototype or an MVP and functionality
matter much much much more than the looks, you can ask your developer to
simply use the material UI kit, it will look rather generic, but clean
and accurate. BAM! 50\$ - 4800\$ per month saved!
