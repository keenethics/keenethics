      <p>
        When integrating online business with a payment processing system, forward-thinking
        companies usually choose Stripe API Integration, PayPal or Braintree. Each of these
        systems works great. The choice mostly depends on your requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stripe is known as a powerful and flexible software platform for running a business
        online. Whether you are building a subscription service, an on-demand marketplace, an
        e-commerce store, or a crowdfunding platform, Stripe Payment System will suit you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key features of Stripe are that in almost all cases, Stripe is a cheaper option than
        PayPal because of lower service fees. Stripe is an always-improving product that gains
        new features every month. Integrating Stripe API means you get early access to the
        latest technologies, from Apple Pay to Bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, Stripe values data portability. If you decide to leave Stripe, your Stripe
        Developers can migrate your credit card data in a secure and PCI-Compliant way. It is
        good to know you have a choice, and will not be locked in forever.
      </p>
