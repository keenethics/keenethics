      <h1>Hire Senior Developer</h1>
      <p>
        For big promising projects and startups, the technical part of the deal is important to
        succeed. Short-sighted decisions and bad implementation can make the whole project fail.
        That is why hiring a Lead Developer to manage technical issues is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, there are other reasons why you should hire a senior developer for your project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You need a tech visionary;</li>
        <li>You want your existing team to grow;</li>
        <li>You need a solution now.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Experience matters. A senior developer can solve more issues at the same time and he
        identifies the weak points earlier. Moreover, hiring a senior developer makes your team
        stronger and gives growth opportunities for your existing team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hiring a remote senior developer will make your project more cost-efficient. Since
        offshore software development vendors are not settled in countries with the most
        expensive cost of living, lower rates do not mean lower quality. You can receive more
        for the same price. We suggest to you to consider Eastern Europe as a reliable
        outsourcing destination. For example, hiring the senior developer here can cost you like
        hiring a Middle or even a Junior Developer on your local market.
