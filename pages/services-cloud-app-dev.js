          <h2>What Is Cloud Application Development?</h2>
          <p>
            Cloud application services range from building a custom solution from scratch to migrating your existing
            system into the cloud. Or you could integrate your solution with other cloud services, such as AWS or Azure.
            There are three methods of cloud software delivery: SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service),
            and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). They let you as a client delegate a great share of responsibilities
            to outside vendors.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you develop a software product on-premises, you have to manage the application, data, runtime, middleware,
            operating system, servers, storage, virtualization, and networking on your own. If you choose to employ SaaS
            business model, you delegate all of these to your service providers. By employing PaaS, you delegate everything
            but applications and data. In turn, if you follow the IaaS approach, you delegate only servers, storage, and networking.
