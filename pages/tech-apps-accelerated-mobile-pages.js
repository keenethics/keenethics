      <h1>AMP Web Design and Development Services</h1>
      <p>
        It comes as no surprise that approximately 60% of world population
        utilize smartphones as their daily driver for web browsing. These small,
        yet, efficient devices have proven to be not only helpful but much more
        convenient than a traditional laptop. Thus, the need for a Google
        accelerated mobile page (AMP) setup is paramount. With this technology,
        web pages load significantly faster and the overall user experience
        becomes much better. The system will boost your earnings and you will
        end up getting more visitors to your site.

      <h2>Google AMP Development Service</h2>
      <p>
        Back in 2016, Google launched the AMP project and ever since, the
        popularity of it grew immensely. The basic idea behind this service is
        to increase performance of each page by loading assets much faster.
        These so-called accelerated mobile pages are very responsive and are
        often utilized by every major e-commerce company. The core benefit of
        given framework is that you develop content once and enhance it
        basically everywhere. According to Google, the AMP will load five times
        faster while eating ten times fewer mobile data. Moreover, the company
        announced that their web engine will favor AMP-powered pages more than
        the traditional ones. Another key component of this project is the fact
        that by incorporating this technology, the bounce rate will be reduced,
        making your potential clients stay on the website longer due to a
        positive and instant experience. Last but not least, enhanced pages will
        be featured in Google search more often. Ignoring such service may
        potentially result in the loss of traffic, engagements, and clicks.

      <h2>Advantages Of Accelerated Mobile Pages (Amp)</h2>
      <p>
        AMP incorporates a full set of benefits which your business can harvest
        from day one. To give you an idea, here are some of the immediate
        effects that AMP brings to the table.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Faster website loading times</strong> - By eliminating useless
          elements, the page becomes less bloated and the overall load time is
          reduced. Visitors to your site will enjoy the fact that the layout is
          clear and responsive;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Increased mobile ranking</strong> - Despite the fact that AMP
          is not a ranking booster, it still has an impact on the rank of the
          website because your pages load faster. If by any chance Google starts
          to prioritize AMP-powered pages, your SERP rank will increase
          dramatically;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improved server response</strong> - If your business
          experience a huge influx of users, the stress they put on the server
          will essentially be reduced. This will lead to reduced expenses as you
          server maintenance procedures will be cut in half. Not to mention the
          fact that the available space can lead to the modernization of the
          site;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improved SEO</strong> - The need for customized content will
          be reduced and you will able to gather data much faster. Moreover,
          your page will show up in the search engine more frequently;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No need for a dedicated map site</strong> - you don&apos;t have to
          create an XML file for your site as Google will pick them for you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although the benefits are clear, there are a few minor drawbacks the
        system is known for. The AMP does support Google Analytics, but you
        would be forced to use different tags as the results will end up being
        mixed. However, it is critical to mention that placing tags on an AMP
        page is just as easy as placing them on a non-powered page. True, this
        generates more work for you, but as mentioned above, the advantages
        simply overweight the cons. There is no real reason for you not to
        implement the form. With AMP enabled on your website, your business
        activities will increase in performance. Thus, if you decide on
        implementing the accelerated mobile page system, contact us as we have
        been working with the system since its launch.
