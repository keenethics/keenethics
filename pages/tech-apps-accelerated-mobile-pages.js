      <h1>Accelerated Mobile Pages</h1>
      <p>
        We are pretty sure that you know the fact that 40% of users click off after 3 seconds if
        the website did not launch. No wonder the performance of your mobile site is so
        important.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of ways to achieve those magnificent page speed results and improve the
        user experience. On of the most efficient is called Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is AMP and who is AMP for? Accelerated Mobile Page is a project from Google and
        Twitter designed to make really fast mobile pages. It&apos;s basically a stripped-down
        form of HTML, a ‘diet’ HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google AMP is a new open framework built entirely out of existing web technologies,
        which allows websites to build light-weight webpages. Essentially a framework for
        creating mobile web pages, AMP pages are built with 3 core components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AMP HTML is HTML with some restrictions for reliable performance;</li>
        <li>The AMP JS library ensures the fast rendering of AMP HTML pages;</li>
        <li>The Google AMP Cache can be used to serve cached AMP HTML pages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Therefore, it is better (and safer) to choose software developers, that have strong
        experience in the stack of technologies listed above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who uses AMP? In the list of domains publishing AMP pages you will find E-commerce
        projects (Wego, Womp mobile, Milestone), publishers (The Washington Post, Nobrocker,
        Relay Media), advertisers (Teads.tv, plista) and others.
      </p>
      <h2>Accelerated Mobile Pages Pros and Cons</h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned, Google AMP helps to make your web pages very fast and load instantly. You
        do not need to look for custom solutions for different platforms: iOS, Android,
        WinPhone, BlackBerry etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        What are the Google AMP cons? You will have to maintain at least two versions of any
        article page: The original version of your article page that users will typically see,
        and the AMP page version. But it is still an easy thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our customers often ask what is AMP for SEO and is AMP SEO-friendly. AMP have two
        benefits for SEO. One is it will have a “Fast” label designation on search engine
        results pages, and the other is that it will be a ranking factor. So yes, for SEO AMP is
        good.
