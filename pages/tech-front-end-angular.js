      <h2>AngularJS Developers</h2>
      <p>
        AngularJS in a JavaScript-based open-source framework. But what is angularjs good for
        and where is its place in the list of technologies? Developers pick angularjs
        development for building front-end web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Angular JS not only helps to increase apps speed and performance but also, gives control
        over scalability and helps to meet huge data requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an angularjs development environment can be used integrated development environments
        for JavaScript. Thanks to this, engineers are free to chose their favorite one for
        angular development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the help of angularjs development tools the required work can be done better and
        slightly faster. Many templates, libraries and a wide range of components give the
        developer an opportunity to avoid distraction and concentrate on the process.
      </p>
      <h3>Hire AngularJS Developers</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that establishing effective communication is important for business
        relationship. It is especially important for those who decide to outsource development.
        Hiring an offshore angularjs development company is a beneficial choice. This decision
        will help you save money without additional risks. All you need to do is to hire an
        experienced team of professionals. When picking your partner from the list of angularjs
        development companies pay attention to company&apos;s related experience and, if itâ€™s
        possible, look for some feedbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the Kennethics spaceship we have completed dozens of projects, from small 2-week
        projects to more complex applications. Some of them contain efficient angularjs examples
        and reflect our experience. Also, we can give you an angularjs web service example we
        have developed for our clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice, that we strongly recommend to our clients to start new projects on Angular2, the
        updated and more powerful version of Angular. Angular still can be used to support old
        projects. But on our opinion, if the project is successful, it is reasonable to move it
        to Angular2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our astronauts use only official and realized angularjs tools and avoid suspicious
        software. In the end, you will receive a high-quality application, build exactly to meet
        your business expectations. Contact us anytime if you want to get more information.
