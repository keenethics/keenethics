        Launching a Web or Mobile App is simple. But if you want to get more than an average
        result and receive an App that will stand out on the market, a stack of technologies is
        required. Here we will try to explain how Express JS development can improve the quality
        of your App.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the official website, Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web
        application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile
        applications. It is the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. Such as many
        other frameworks, ExpressJS is a free open-source software. You will not have to add
        extra-costs to your budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is ExpressJS good for and when do you need to hire a team of Express JS
        Developers? Mostly, ExpressJS framework is being used for creating cutting-edge Web
        Applications and APIs for various Desktop and Mobile platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        For an Expressjs development team, creating a robust API using Expressjs is quick and
        easy. Furthermore, ExpressJS examples show good performance. Express provides a thin
        layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that
        developers use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many other frameworks, often they help to complete specific tasks, are based on Express:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Feathers;</li>
        <li>ItemsAPI;</li>
        <li>KeystoneJS;</li>
        <li>LoopBack;</li>
        <li>Kraken and others.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This fact proves that the ExpressJS framework is flexible and powerful enough for
        achieving a range of ambitious goals.
      </p>
      <h2>Hire ExpressJS Developers</h2>
      <p>
        If you are not planning to hire or grow your in-house development team, look for a
        trustworthy Express JS development company abroad and involve a dedicated development
        team in your project. Data shows, that Eastern Europe is now one of the most prominent
        outsourcing destinations. Offshore Expressjs development companies usually offer lower
        rates without any lack of quality. Companyâ€™s managers take care about day-to-day
        operations and office routine, so you can save time and spend it on strategic planning.
