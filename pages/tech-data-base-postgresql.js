      <h1>PostgreSQL Development</h1>
      <p>
        Let’s start from what is PostgreSQL and what are its main benefits. Shortly, PostgreSQL
        is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with more than 15 years of
        active development.
      </p>
      <p>
        PostgreSQL’s source code is available under an open source license. This license gives
        the freedom to use, modify and distribute PostgreSQL in any form.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key pros of PostgreSQL is that it is highly customizable. PostgreSQL runs
        stored procedures in more than a dozen programming languages, including Java, Node.js,
        Perl, Python, Ruby, C/C++, and its own PL/pgSQL, which is similar to Oracle’s PL/SQL.
        PostgreSQL database developers can run it on all major operating systems, including
        Linux, UNIX, and Windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a long list of other PostgreSQL benefits for your project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Significant saving on staffing costs. PostgreSQL has been designed and created to have
          much lower maintenance and tuning requirements, yet still retain all of the features,
          stability, and performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reliability and stability. It is extremely common for companies to report that
          PostgreSQL has never, ever crashed in several years of high activity operation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extensible. The source code is available to all at no charge. If we need to customise
          or extend PostgreSQL in any way, we are able to do so with a minimum of effort, and
          with no attached costs. This is complemented by the community of PostgreSQL
          professionals and enthusiasts around the globe that also actively extend PostgreSQL on
          a daily basis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed for high volume environments. PostgreSQL is extremely responsive in high
          volume environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          GUI database design and administration tools. There are many high-quality GUI Tools
          available for PostgreSQL development from both open source developers and commercial
          providers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        PostgreSQL has a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for
        reliability, data integrity, and correctness. You should definitely choose PostgreSQL
        vs. MySQL for potentially scalable, fast-growing projects. But PostgreSQL is not only
        a powerful database system capable of running enterprise projects, it is a development
        platform to build web and software products as well.
      </p>
      <h2>PostgreSQL Database Developers</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to hire PostgreSQL developers and keep you budget cost-efficient, consider
        offshore software development service providers. Reasonable rates, huge talent pool,
        and favourable business climate make Ukraine one of the best destinations for
        outsourcing PostgreSQL services to.
      </p>
      <p>
        When choosing a PostgreSQL service vendor in Ukraine, take into account several
        factors: what company’s portfolio says about expertise in various domains and
        technology areas, long-term partnerships with customers, available engagement models,
        does the company follow Agile Methodologies, etc. Check if the company has experience
        in other database systems, for example, MySQL.
