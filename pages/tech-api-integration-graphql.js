      <p>
        In short, what is GraphQL and how this technology can make your app greater?
      </p>
      <p>
        GraphQL is a query language for your API which lets developers describe the complex,
        nested data dependencies of modern applications. GraphQL is designed to operate over a
        single endpoint via HTTP, optimizing for performance and flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skilled GraphQL developers can use it with any language or platform to define appâ€™s
        backend as a well-defined schema.
      </p>
      <p>
        GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in an API, gives
        clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to
        evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow
        references between them. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs,
        GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long story short, the key benefits of GraphQL app development are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apps can use types to avoid writing manual parsing code;</li>
        <li>
          Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not the
          server.
        </li>
        <li>Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our GraphQL developers can grow your app from a small project all the way to something
        big. An amazing scalability is one of the main reasons why companies prefer GraphQL. Of
        course, everything depends on your projects. Here we suggest to you to contact our
        astronauts to receive a free tech advice about GraphQL, REST and other technologies.

      <p>
        Who is using GraphQL? GraphQL is used by teams of all sizes in many different
        environments and languages to power mobile apps, websites, and APIs. Facebook&apos;s
        mobile apps have been powered by GraphQL since 2012. In the list of companies using
        GraphQL development you will find such giants as GitHub, Airbnb, Pinterest, Coursera,
        Meteor, Shopify, Mixcloud, M1 Finance, Intuit and others.
