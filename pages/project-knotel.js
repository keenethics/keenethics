              Headquarters as a Service: Knotel provides comprehensive office services powered by
              domain experts and best of breed technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teams are shrinking. The growth of entrepreneurship and the independent workforce are
              leading to changes in traditional office environments. The new office worker demands a
              new office environment. The checklist for the modern CEO has also changed dramatically
            </p>
            <p>
              Knotel is meeting this need by providing an open planned and on demand office that is
              operated, not fresh. Spaces that are flexible, not leased. Pricing is inclusive and
              simple.
            </p>
            <p>
              As hosted workspace solutions proliferate a pattern of serving smaller, high churn
              demographics has emerged. Yet, solutions for serious, growing professional teams
              (venture backed, CEO led, purposeful groups growing businesses) are in great demand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knotel is hosted workspaces for serious growing teams. We focus on a low churn, mature
              clientele. Our team is made up of well connected, veteran founders, as well as former
              WeWork, Starwood and NeueHouse executives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knotel is the next level in company-sized workspaces.
