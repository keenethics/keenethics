            <div className="title">Importance of Revenue Management</div>
            <p>
              These days, there are very few successful businesses that consider revenue management
              unnecessary. It is virtually impossible to help the company boost the revenue growth if
              it has no tools to connect with their customers or understand changes in their business.
            </p>
            <p>
              The revenue management of the previous decades is the procedure based on pricing by
              occupancy-level or plain seasonal strategies. The revenue management of today is almost
              supernatural mechanism. Due to the implementation of machine learning into their daily
              operations, hotels shifted to open pricing. They forecast booking curves in real time
              and make corresponding adjustments. The most successful hotels change their prices
              hundreds of times every day.
            </p>
