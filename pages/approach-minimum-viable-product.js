      <h1>MVP development services for startups and existing businesses</h1>
      <p>
        For a few years now, the MVP development pattern has high demand on the market,
        especially among startups, as one of the most prominent and efficient ways to create a
        valuable product.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MVP development wiki defines after Eric Ries: MVP is a product with just enough
        features to gather validated learning about the product and its continued development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with the development of minimum viable product is a lean startup tactic.
        Classic MVP product development includes developing of the minimum amount of features to
        validate the value proposition hypotheses. Usually, MVP development process starts from
        the highlighting product’s key features and its core value for users. Understanding
        business goals will help each MVP developer in the team to improve his performance and
        deliver smart solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key benefits of minimum viable product development are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a chance to check if the hypotheses works on the market;</li>
        <li>
          keeping the focus on the product’s main features, in other words, your future USP;
        </li>
        <li>receiving feedback from the real users as soon as possible;</li>
        <li>getting and collecting information about potential customers;</li>
        <li>saving costs, time and recourses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The desire to create a perfect product at once only delays potential failure rather than
        guarantees success. Also, MVP lean development helps not to overbuilt a product and
        reduces rework. Therefore, MVP actually improves a product’s chance to win on the
        market.
