        In a nutshell, there are a few main advantages of creating desktop applications with
        the help of web technologies. Firstly, it gives the possibility to customize the UI
        and you are not limited by any platform. Secondly, the app becomes portable and
        easy to use, regardless of the device. Web application needs to be installed only once,
        on a server that is connected to the internet and can be accessed by a browser.
