      <h1>Electron App Development</h1>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s start from what is Electron and how it can improve your business. You may
        want to look for Electron development services when creating a cross-platform desktop
        application for your company or idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly, Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies
        like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The main idea behind developing desktop apps with
        JavaScript is that Electron developers build one codebase and package it for each
        operating system separately. This fact also makes maintenance easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 3 main benefits of Electron development:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Electron uses Chromium and Node.js so you can build your app with HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          Electron is an open source project maintained by GitHub and an active community of
          contributors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux, Electron apps build and run on three
          platforms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The great thing about Electron is that Electron framework helps to focus on the core of
        your application. Initially developed for GitHub&apos;s Atom editor, Electron has since
        been used to create applications by companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Slack, and
        Docker.

        Hiring an offshore Electron App development company is far more cost-efficient as rates
        per hour usually are lower because of the location. All you need to do is to find a
        trustworthy software service vendor. Then there will be no need to worry about the
        quality of the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ukraine remains one of the top IT outsourcing destinations in Eastern Europe due to its
        impressive talent pool, reasonable prices, continually developing business
        infrastructure and interest towards new technologies and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        When choosing an offshore Electron App development company, first of all, pay attention
        to the stack of technologies company uses. Skilled Electron App developers must have
        strong expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. If you have found an offshore
        software development vendor specializing in hybrid app development, it means you hit the
        jackpot.
