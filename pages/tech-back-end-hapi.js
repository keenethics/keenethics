      <h1>Hapi.js Development Services</h1>
      <p>
        For most of the web-based projects basic web development tools are not enough. To
        build a project in the best way possible, development teams involve different
        technologies and frameworks depending on the wanted result.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the list of often used frameworks, you will definitely find Hapi.js. Let us start
        from what is Hapi JavaScript framework and for what type of projects it is used. In
        short, Hapi is a framework for building applications and services of different
        complexity, from eCommerce to powerful enterprise applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hapi.js framework has a few benefits making development easier and faster:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Easier setup with ready-to-go defaults;</li>
        <li>Good error handling;</li>
        <li>Powerful reply interface;</li>
        <li>Better testability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Another good thing about Hapi.js development is that it enables developers to focus on
        writing application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure.

        For many small to large companies, outsourcing remains one of the most effective tools
        to keep the budget within reason. Outsourcing can save up to 40% of costs compared to
        in-house development. We suggest to you to consider Eastern Europe as an outsourcing
        destination due to the best cost-quality balance.
