        On the Keenethics spaceship, we have experience integrating Twilio Programmable Voice
        into native and progressive apps. In short, what is Twilio and when to use it? Twilio
        itself is a cloud communications platform. It offers Voice & Video, Messaging, and
        Authentication APIs for every application. You can use Twilio products, if your Appâ€™s
        Backend is written in PHP, Node, Python, Ruby, Java, .NET (C#).
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmable Voice from Twilio helps to build unique phone call experiences with one
        API to make, receive, control, and monitor calls. On our opinion, Twilio Programmable
        Voice is developer-friendly, feature-rich, and scalable.

        Also, we have experience integrating Alexa Voice Service (AVS) for native and hybrid
        apps. In general, what is Amazon Alexa and does your app need it? Alexa is an
        intelligent personal assistant developed by Amazon Lab126. It is capable of voice
        interaction, making to-do lists, setting alarms, providing weather, traffic, and other
        real-time information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amazon allows device manufacturers to integrate Alexa Voice capabilities into their own
        connected products by using the Alexa Voice Service, a cloud-based service that provides
        APIs to interface with Alexa. Products built using Alexa API have access to Alexa&apos;s
        growing list of capabilities, and there are no fees for companies looking to integrate
        Alexa into their products by using AVS.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the frequently asked questions is how much does Amazon Alexa Voice Service cost
        and is it time-consuming. We suggest to you to tell us more about your projects, so we
        can provide clearer estimates.
