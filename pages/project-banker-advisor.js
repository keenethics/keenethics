              Prior to cooperating with any bank, a buyer needs to learn about bank fees,
              interest rates, and customer services. Asking an expert for advice could make
              one’s business up and running. What if we could bring an expert opinion into the smartphone?
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea behind BankerAdvisor was to create an efficient investment banking
              service for both buyers and advisory firms that would provide relevant insights
              into bank operations based on verified client reviews. Buyers would be able to
              make better decisions and investment banks and advisory firms would be able to
              improve their services relying on clients’ feedbacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              For us, this app is an opportunity to make the investment banking more efficient by
              providing unbiased reviews and showing the advisory services their weaknesses and strengths.

              Mike Casey has more than 30 years of experience in the financial and operational
              leadership. Having served as CFO in several leading public software and technology
              companies, such as MAPICS, iXL Enterprises, Manhattan Associates and IQ Software,
              noticed that it was quite a challenge to pick the right service for each specific
              sector. Neither was it easy to ensure a smooth transaction experience. After a
              thorough analysis, Mr. Casey figured the common problem of all companies:

              Keenethics have been hired to develop a solution that helps buyers
              see the realistic picture of the investment banking market by providing
              the users with an access to the client reviews. Our main goal was to make a
              resourceful application that would simplify the choice of banks for cooperation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, we wanted to make this application valuable for the bank owners who’d
              be able to use the feedbacks as the first step in overcoming the weaknesses
              in the operation of their businesses.

                    most reviews. A user may add a rated review with recommendations
                    to a service. At the same time, bank owners are able to create
                    a new listing or claim the existing one by setting
                    premium accounts using Stripe service.

                    We created the separate Customer Journey Maps for buyers and

              The website has flexible payment plans and works in sync with the Stripe
