          <h2>What Is Node.js?</h2>
          <p>Node.js is a free, open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment for JavaScript. It allows executing code outside of a browser, which enables us to develop a sustainable, scalable, and resource-efficient application.</p>
          <p>The Node.js software development community has developed several server frameworks in order to accelerate the development process of apps and websites. Among such frameworks, there are Express.js, Meteor, Derby etc. Thanks to a broad range of frameworks and libraries available, Node.js web development and Node.js application development have become the most efficient solution for achieving specific business goals.</p>
