              An idea behind this application was to help people organize social-campaigns through
              email-contacts that campaign-supporters have. This could serve as an alternative to
              Facebook and other social-networks in some cases.

              Let’s say you want to support law that restricts production of some products dangerous
              for the environment. In a few clicks you can create a campaign and add your friends’
              emails to it with a message that you’ll appreciate if they spread information on this
              campaign to their friends. Each of your friends can do the same thing spreading it
              wider to their friends which finally may have everyone involved in the campaign given
              people really support it.
