            <h1>Why do we support<br />Open Source?</h1>
            <p>
              Whether you want it or not, businesses and regular users rely on open source
              software. Most of the servers and super-computers run Linux. Android-phones gained
              large market-share. Huge amount of web- and mobile-applications are built on top of
              open-source frameworks and libraries.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main reason for business to use open-source software is higher cost-efficiency.
              Just think about it: you can build your application on top of huge experience of
              previous developers. You can avoid their mistakes and take best parts from their
              practices. And that’s usually totally free.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example when using JavaScript for applications you can benefit from a huge
              amount (around half a million) of packages available through npm. There’s even a
              joke that you can’t think of a word that isn’t used as a name of package!
            </p>
            <p>
              node.js which is used to run JavaScript on the server-side is also totally
              open-source and supported by several companies. Chrome and Firefox together have
              more than a half of browsers’ market share. And they are also open-source.
            </p>
            <p>
              But open source is not only about cost. It’s also about quality and security. This
              kind of software can be improved or forked by any of it’s users. Issues can be
              reported and fixed pretty quickly given they affect large amount of users.
            </p>
            <p>
              And this is where ethical approach takes place. Not only we use open-source, but
              also we support it. We even have it in our competencies matrix. Open-source
              contributions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                can have direct benefit for a project developer works on (e. g. some bug in the
                framework can be fixed);
              </li>
              <li>
                increases code-quality of contributor: his code should pass code-review of other
                developers working on the same open-source project and should fit well with their
                architectural approach;
              </li>
              <li>
                improves our world and increases number of problems that can be easily resolved
                via open-source;
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Besides, working with open source is usually fun for those who are really passionate
              about software-development. When helping improve something, or when building some
              new library, usually you aren’t limited with budget, but only with your own time.
              Some even treat open-source as their hobby and build truly amazing projects just via
              their enthusiasm.
