              the promotion of their products or services to the specific target groups.

            <div className="title">Reconsidering your Approach to Sales</div>
            <p>
              Some of your prospects may not even realize that they want your product until they
              see it. At the same time, there are many people who will never buy anything from you.
              The businesses achieve the best results when they put themselves out there and reach
              their target audience. Why so? Because according to the Pareto principle, 80% of profits
              come from 20% of customers, just like the 80% of sales come from 20% of advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, the business needs promotion, but it must be effective. This is exactly the kind
              of assistance that The Check Network provides. Their service is the 80:20 principle in action.
