              <p>
                The Check Network is a unique business development and promotion platform, which presents universal solutions for companies from different industries. This ecommerce platform for SEO purposes is built as an international network, which combines localized price comparison websites in a variety of themes and subjects, ranging from coffee products to equestrian goods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each website offers a concise overview of all businesses marketing in a certain field and provides a side-by-side comparison of their prices. In this way, businesses are able to show their advantage over competitors and to target exactly the audience that they may appeal to. In turn, customers are offered a priceless opportunity to find a vendor or a service provider that suits them the most. Such an approach enables growing agencies, brands, and e-stores to get the most advantage from their platforms by promoting their products or services to the specific target groups and generating extra sales. This ecommerce platform for SEO is not about economizing or underperforming. Instead, it is all about doing the right thing in the right place and at the right time.

              <h2>Our Cooperation</h2>
              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p>The first priority of this client was <b>scalability</b>: as the network grows more extended, new business domains are added. Respectively, the client wanted to be able to introduce such structural changes by himself without asking for help from developers. More than that, scalability directly translates in a constantly increasing data load, which is bound to bring about another challenge – <b>data security and reliability</b>. Finally, choosing the best ecommerce platform to advertise or to consult with, users pay attention to the topicality of data presented there. Therefore, impeccable <b>synchronization</b> is another challenge for the platform to be updated 24/7.</p>
              <h3>Our Team</h3>
              <p>This project was designed and managed by the client himself. On our part, we provided him with three proficient software developers and an expert QA specialist to bring his idea of the ecommerce platform for SEO and business vision to life.</p>
              <h3>Technologies</h3>
              <p>As the client is well-experienced in the field, he has done all the business analysis, UI/UX design, and marketing by himself. Our job was to develop a perfect web application. For the development of this ecommerce platform for SEO, we have used Meteor and React.</p>
              <ul className="technologies-list">

                </li>
                <li className="technologies-item">

                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Methodology</h3>
              <p>
                Our client as the Project Manager insisted that we work according to the principles of Scrum, and we fully agreed to it. The requirements were altering, new features were added, the prioritization of tasks underwent changes on a regular basis. Scrum is the best <a href="/blog/how-to-choose-your-optimal-development-methodology" target="_blank">PM methodology</a> for flexible cooperation in such circumstances.

              <h2>What Makes The Check Network Special?</h2>
