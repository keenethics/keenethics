              SelfLeaders is a Swedish company that helps their customers create strong cultures where co 
              workers are engaged, drive development and take care of themselves and each other.

            <div className="title">How it works</div>
            <p>
              Understanding personal values is the key to understanding your own motivation. Ever since 
              the start of SelfLeaders in 2009, this method has been central in our approach to working 
              with individual and organizational transformation.
            </p>
            <p>SelfLeaders delivers trainings to businesses, NGOs and the public sector with the aim to 
              help them to become truly value-based. SelfLeaders workshops would be impossible without 
              application which we made. This application is a tool for facilitators and participants of 
              workshops. Tool’s functionality helps to conduct workshop with interacting materials, videos, 
              presentations, etc.
