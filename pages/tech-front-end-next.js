      <h2>Next.js Development Services</h2>
      <p>
        To create a powerful web app, a wide range of frontend and backend technologies is being
        used. The concrete choice depends on a variety of factors, starting from main business
        goals and ending up with the budget and time limits. Recently, building server-rendered
        React apps with Next.js is one of our most-requested services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Next.js framework is a new addition to the React open-source ecosystem. Next is a
        framework for universal server-rendered React applications that makes the process of
        building these types of applications much faster, and easier. With Next.js development,
        it is easier to focus on the business logic, not on the framework itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For developers, Next framework offers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>no configuration or additional setup;</li>
        <li>easy component and global style with Glamor library;</li>
        <li>
          automatic transpilation and bundling (with your own Webpack configurations and Babel);
        </li>
        <li>hot code reloading;</li>
        <li>route prefetching.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also, the Next.js framework is able to implement with Express or any other Node.js HTTP
        server.

      <h3>Hire Next.js Developers</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most effective and safe ways to keep the software development budget within
        reason is to outsource a part of the project or the whole project to a software
        development service provider. Many businesses consider East-European countries like
        Ukraine to establish long-term cooperation. Good location (2-hour flight from key
        European capitals), reasonable rates and highly-educated developers make Ukrainian
        market one of the most prominent in the region.
      </p>
